# ComputerGraphic
Exploring topics in Computer Graphic

## Motivation
This project aims to document a personal journey of understanding the fundamentals of computer graphics. In addition, it would host some relative experimentation projects that I may find interesting. Finally, I would explore C++, Cmake, and UI libraries (Qt) more deeply throughout the various projects.

I will use "Interactive Computer Graphics: A Top-Down Approach Using OpenGL" by "Edward Angel" as a guide to navigating multiple topics to implement as many ideas as possible.

I will also be using other online resources and will document links and solutions for challenges within code.
